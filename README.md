A sidenote: I made this project as way to learn C++, so it is full of memory leaks and some things are probably poorly done.

# Leviathan Engine

A Simple 2d Game Engine Made with SDL + Lua

## Goals

This is my first big project with C++ and Lua, I don't expect it to scale much, I actually just want to get started with game development in C++ and I found SDL to be great for simple game engines!

Currently I'm working on a Windows machine, thus it probably cannot be built on Linux/MAC yet. I plan to support
these two platforms in the future as the code is written in SDL and the current state of it is 100% portable.
